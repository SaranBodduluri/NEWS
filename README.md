DSC NEWS is a clone website to the actual google news website.
It is created using rudimentary css and then html is used to style and structure the webpage.
Along with these, JavaScript is used to make the webpage actually functional by dynamically changing the content of webpage using DOM manipulation and fetching data through HackerNews and OpenWeatherMap API's .
